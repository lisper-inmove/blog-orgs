* What is Hough Transform

The Hough Transform works by transforming the image from image space (pixels) to a parameter space that represents possible shapes.
In this space, each point in the image "votes" for all possible shapes that could pass through it. The shapes that receive the most votes are considered detected.

** Hough line Transform
Used to detect straight lines
#+attr_formula:
#+begin_src latex
  \[
  \rho = x \cos\theta + y \sin\theta
  \]
#+end_src
ρ is the perpendicular distance(垂直距离) from the origin to the line.
θ is the angle between the x-axis and the perpendicular to the line.

** Hough Circle Transform
#+attr_formula:
#+begin_src latex
  \[
  (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2
  \]
#+end_src
Used to detect circles
