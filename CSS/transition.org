* Key Concepts

*If you just need a simple animation, use transition. Else use the Animation*

1. Transitions are easy to use: They can be applied with just a few lines of CSS.
2. Enhance user experience: Smooth transitions make the interface feel more responsive and interactive.
3. Control: You can precisely control the timing, duration, and easing of the transitions.
4. Limitations: Transitions are limited to changes between two states. For more complex animations, you may need to use CSS animations or JavaScript.
5. Not all CSS properties are transitionable. Commonly used transitionable properties include /opacity/, /color/, /background-color/, /transform/, and many more. Properties like /display/ cannot be transitioned.

* Properties
The transition property is a shorthand property for the four transition properties:

1. *transition-property*: Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for.
2. *transition-duration*: Specifies how long the transition effect takes to complete.
3. *transition-timing-function*: Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
4e *transition-delay*: Specifies when the transition effect will start.

* An Example
#+begin_src css
  .transition-test {
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
  }

  .transition-test:hover {
    background-color: #45a049;
  }
